================================================================================
2. QUICK START - GET RACING IN 5 MINUTES
================================================================================

INITIAL SETUP (FIRST TIME ONLY):

Step 1: Add Your CBFTP Server
1. Click ""CBFTP Server"" button in main window.
2. Fill in:
   - Host: Your CBFTP server IP/hostname
   - Port: Usually 55477
   - Password: Your CBFTP API password
   - Profile: e.g. ""RACE""
3. Click ""Save"".

Step 2: Import Sites from CBFTP
1. Click ""Sync From CBFTP"".
2. Select your CBFTP server from the dropdown.
3. Click ""Fetch Sites"".
4. Tick the sites you want to import.
5. Click ""Import Selected Sites"".
6. Sites are now created with names and categories.
   (Only categories and sitename are imported; you still configure IRC yourself.)

BASIC CONFIGURATION (AFTER IMPORT):

Now configure a site for racing:

1. Select a site from the site dropdown (top of main window).
2. Click ""Edit Site"" (or double-click the site).
3. In the Site Editor:
   - Make sure the IRC section you want to race is present in the top-left
     ""IRC Sections"" list (add if needed).
   - In the bottom-left ""Race Sections (irc)"" list, make sure that section
     is **Enabled** using the Enable/Disable buttons.
   - In the top-left ""IRC Sections"" list, select that section (e.g. ""TV-1080P"").
   - In the top-middle ""Cbftp Sections"" list, select the matching CBFTP section
     (e.g. ""TV-1080P"" or ""MOVIES-HD"").
   - Click ""Map"".
   - In ""Mapping trigger (regex)"" enter: .*   (match everything).
   - Leave Section Rules and Tag Rules empty for now.
   - Click ""Save"" in the site editor.

4. Start the trader. You should see:
   - [DETECTED] in the Race log when an announce hits.
   - [RACING] when the spreadjob is started.
   - [COMPLETED]/[FAILED]/[TIMEOUT] when CBFTP finishes.

Alternative: Manual Site Setup (Without CBFTP Import):

1. Click ""Add Site"".
2. In the Site Editor:
   - General:
     • Sitename: must match CBFTP sitename if you want auto section import.
     • Announce: choose announce bot/mode from dropdown.
   - ZNC/IRC:
     • Host, Port
     • Username / network
     • Password (stored encrypted)
   - Channels:
     • Add announce channels in ""Channels"" list.
     • Add Blowfish keys where needed.
3. In ""Race Sections and Mapping"":
   - Add IRC sections (these usually match the site's paths, e.g. TV-DE, MP3).
   - In bottom-left ""Race Sections (irc)"", Enable those sections.
   - Map each IRC section to one or more CBFTP sections.
   - Set ""Mapping trigger (regex)"" for each mapping (tag).
4. Click ""Save"".

TL;DR:
- Add CBFTP server → Sync sites → Edit each site → Enable IRC sections
  in ""Race Sections (irc)"" → Map IRC → CBFTP → Done.

Quick Explanation:
- IRC Section   = What the site announces in IRC (e.g. [TV-DE], [X264-HD]).
- CBFTP Section = Logical section name in CBFTP (e.g. TV-DE, MOVIES-HD).
- Mapping (Tag) = IRC section + CBFTP section + trigger regex (+ tag rules).
- Section Rules = Filters that apply to **all** mappings for that IRC section.
- Tag Rules     = Filters for **one** mapping only (per CBFTP section).

================================================================================
3. CORE CONCEPTS - UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM
================================================================================

HOW IT WORKS - THE FLOW
------------------------

Step 1: IRC ANNOUNCE RECEIVED
  Example:
    ""[TV-DE] Show.Name.S01E01.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP""

Step 2: EXTRACT SECTION NAME
  Section: ""TV-DE"" (from the announce line).

Step 3: CHECK IF SECTION IS ENABLED
  Is ""TV-DE"" Enabled in ""Race Sections (irc)"" for this site?  
  - If NO → ignore.  
  - If YES → continue.

Step 4: FIND MATCHING MAPPING
  In ""Race Sections and Mapping"", find a mapping where:
    - IRC Section is ""TV-DE""
    - The mapping's ""Mapping trigger (regex)"" matches the release name.

  The **first** mapping whose trigger matches will be used.

Step 5: EVALUATE RULES
  1. Section rules for the IRC section (TV-DE):
     - All DROP rules evaluated first.
     - Then Section ALLOW rules.
  2. Tag rules for this mapping (IRC=TV-DE → CBFTP=TV-DE or MOVIES-HD etc):
     - If a Tag rule matches, its ACTION (ALLOW/DROP) is used.
  3. If nothing matches: default action is ALLOW.

Step 6: SEND TO CBFTP (SPREADJOB)
  - Racetrade sends:
        section  = CBFTP section name
        name     = release name
        sites    = list of allowed sites
        profile  = CBFTP profile (e.g. RACE)
  - CBFTP log:
        [JOB SENT]
        [JOB STARTED] Job#1234: Release → CBFTP-Server
  - Race log:
        [RACING] line:
        [2025-.. ..:..:..] :: [TV-DE] :: [SiteAlpha,SiteBeta] :: [RACING] :: Release.Name...

Step 7: MONITOR CBFTP JOB
  - Racetrade periodically polls CBFTP `spreadjobs/{release}`.
  - Reads:
        status (DONE / FAILED / TIMEOUT / ACTIVE / etc)
        sites, sites_incomplete
        size_estimated_bytes
        time_spent_seconds
  - When terminal:
        DONE     → [COMPLETED]
        FAILED   → [FAILED]
        TIMEOUT  → [FAILED] with timeout reason

  Race log examples:
    [COMPLETED] :: [TV-DE] :: [SiteAlpha,SiteBeta] :: Release
    [FAILED]    :: [TV-DE] :: [SiteAlpha,SiteBeta] :: Release (CBFTP transfer failed)

LOG WINDOWS
-----------

Race Log:
  - High-level race info per release:
    [DETECTED], [RACING], [COMPLETED], [FAILED].

CBFTP Log:
  - Detailed job messages and Job# progress.

Application Log:
  - App-level info, errors, rules engine messages.

IRC Log:
  - Raw IRC events: connect, join, announces, FiSH status, errors.

IRC SECTIONS vs CBFTP SECTIONS
-------------------------------

IRC Sections:
- Names emitted by the site in IRC.
- Often equal to the path name on that site.
- Example on SiteAlpha: X264-HD-1080P, TV-DE, MP3.
- Example on SiteBeta: X264-HD, TV, MUSiC.

CBFTP Sections:
- Logical names defined in CBFTP's section config.
- All sites racing together share these names.
- CBFTP handles per-site paths internally for that section.
- Example: MOVIES-HD exists for SiteAlpha and SiteBeta with different paths.

Mapping:
- For each site, you map its IRC sections to shared CBFTP sections:
  SiteAlpha: IRC X264-HD-1080P → CBFTP MOVIES-HD
  SiteBeta : IRC X264-HD       → CBFTP MOVIES-HD

Trigger regex & rules decide which releases go into which mapping.

4. CONFIGURATION WALKTHROUGH
================================================================================

THE UI COMPONENTS
-----------------

TOP LEFT - ZNC SERVER
  - Host, Port, Username, Password
  - Connection details for ZNC/IRC server

TOP MIDDLE - Channels
  - ListBoxChannels: channels for this site
  - ""Add Channel"" / ""Remove Channel"" buttons
  - Blowfish keys entered elsewhere in the editor (if supported)

MIDDLE TOP - Race Sections and Mapping
--------------------------------------

LEFT - IRC Sections (listBox1):
  • List of IRC section names for this site.
  • Add / Remove buttons to manage sections.
  • These names must match the section names in the announces.

MIDDLE - Cbftp Sections (listCbftpSections):
  • List of CBFTP sections available for racing.
  • Typically imported from CBFTP or added manually.

RIGHT - Mapped Section (listBox5):
  • Shows mappings between IRC sections and CBFTP sections.
  • When you select an IRC section and a CBFTP section and click ""Map"",
    the mapping appears here.
  • The ""Mapping trigger (regex)"" textbox below is per-mapping (per tag).
  • Click ""Save"" next to the trigger to store it for the selected mapping.

Buttons:
  - Add/Remove (under IRC Sections): add or delete IRC section names.
  - Map: link selected IRC section → CBFTP section.
  - Unmap: remove a mapping from ""Mapped Section"".
  - Save (next to trigger): save trigger regex for the selected mapping.

BOTTOM MIDDLE - Race Sections (irc)
-----------------------------------

- ListBox2 + Enable / Disable buttons:
  • This list shows the IRC sections for this site.
  • Use **Enable** to activate a section for racing.
  • Use **Disable** to turn it off temporarily.
  • Only **Enabled** sections are processed by the racer.

BOTTOM MIDDLE - Affils (Group Names)
-------------------------

- When a group is detected on the site from an affil group, it triggers the site a DL-Only site.

BOTTOM RIGHT AREA - Rules
-------------------------

Top-right box: **CBFTP Mapping Rules: DROP run before ALLOW rules**  
  (Tag Rules listBox)

  - These rules belong to the **selected mapping** in ""Mapped Section"".
  - They apply only to this single combination of IRC section + CBFTP section.
  - Use them for mapping-specific filters (e.g. MOVIES-HD on one site).
  - Label reminder: ""DROP run before ALLOW rules"" – within this list,
    DROP rules are evaluated before ALLOW rules.

Bottom-right box: **Section Rules: DROP takes priority over ALLOW**  
  (listBox6)

  - These rules apply to **all mappings** in the selected IRC section.
  - Perfect for global blocks:
      [release] contains INTERNAL DROP
      [group]   isin BadGroup1,BadGroup2 DROP
  - First, all Section DROP rules run; then Section ALLOW rules.

4.1 ADDING A NEW SITE
---------------------------------------------

1. In the main window, click ""Add Site"".

2. Site Settings:
   - ZNC server:
       Host / Port / Username / Password (for your bouncer or IRC).
   - General:
       Sitename: must match CBFTP sitename if you want to sync sections.
       Announce: choose the announce bot/mode from dropdown.

3. Channels:
   - Add the announce channels for this site in ""ListboxChannels"".
   - Configure Blowfish keys where needed (chat and/or racing channels).

4. New Regex:
   - Configure how releases are extracted from announces.
   - Usually you already have sane defaults from imports; change only if necessary.

5. Race Sections and Mapping:
   - Add IRC sections in the ""IRC Sections"" list (often same as path names).
   - Use bottom-left ""Race Sections (irc)"" list to Enable sections you want.
   - In the top area:
       • Select an IRC section.
       • Select a CBFTP section.
       • Click ""Map"".
       • Set ""Mapping trigger (regex)"" – start with .* for ""everything"".
       • Click ""Save"" (next to trigger).
   - Add Section Rules (bottom-right) for IRC section-wide filters.
   - Add Tag Rules in ""CBFTP Mapping Rules"" box for mapping-specific filters.

6. Click ""Save"" at bottom.

7. Start trader and verify logs:
   - IRC connects.
   - Announces appear in IRC log.
   - Race log shows [DETECTED] / [RACING] / [COMPLETED].

---------------------------------------------
4.2 EDITING AN EXISTING SITE
---------------------------------------------

1. Select the site from the main window dropdown.
2. Click ""Edit Site"".

Inside the editor you can:
- Change ZNC/IRC host, port, user, pass.
- Add/remove channels and adjust keys.
- Add/remove IRC sections.
- Enable/Disable sections in ""Race Sections (irc)"".
- Create/remove mappings between IRC and CBFTP sections.
- Adjust ""Mapping trigger (regex)"" per mapping.
- Add/modify Section Rules and Tag Rules.
- Toggle options like Disable Site, Download Only Site, Finish Incompletes.

Always click ""Save"" after changes.

Tip: When modifying rules heavily, enable Debug Mode in Settings so rules engine
messages show up in the Application log.

================================================================================
5. RULES SYSTEM - COMPLETE REFERENCE
================================================================================

RULE FORMAT
-----------

    [key] operator value ACTION

- [key]    : Field to check (release, section, group, year, etc.).
- operator : Comparison type.
- value    : Right-hand side of comparison.
- ACTION   : ALLOW or DROP (EXCEPT reserved / advanced).

Examples:
  [release] contains INTERNAL DROP
  [group]   isin BadGroup1,BadGroup2 DROP
  [release] contains 1080p ALLOW

OPERATORS
---------

==          Exact match (case-insensitive)
!=          Not equal
iswm        Wildcard match (* and ?)
matches     Regex pattern match
contains    Substring exists
startswith  Begins with substring
endswith    Ends with substring
isin        Left side is contained in comma/pipe-separated list

AVAILABLE KEYS
--------------

[release]   Full release name.
[section]   IRC section name (e.g. TV-DE, X264-HD).
[group]     Release group name.
[year]      Movie/show year (if extracted).
[quality]   Quality tag (if extracted, e.g. 1080p, 2160p).
[source]    Source tag (if extracted, e.g. WEB, BluRay).

WILDCARD PATTERNS (ISWM)
------------------------

*     Any characters
?     Single character

Examples:
  *1080p*           - contains ""1080p""
  *WEB*             - contains ""WEB""
  *.GERMAN.*        - "".GERMAN."" somewhere
  *S??E??*          - S01E01, S10E23, etc.

REGEX PATTERNS (MATCHES)
------------------------

.     Any character
.*    Anything
.+    One or more
[0-9] Any digit
(a|b) a OR b
^     Start of string
$     End of string
\b    Word boundary
\.    Literal dot

Examples:
  (?i).*1080p.*           - contains 1080p (case-insensitive)
  .*S[0-9]{2}E[0-9]{2}.*  - season/episode S01E01
  ^Movie.*2024$           - starts with Movie and ends with 2024

PRECISE LANGUAGE MATCHES USING \b
---------------------------------

To drop a language without dropping similar words, use regex with \b:

  [release] matches (?i)\bGERMAN\b DROP
  [release] matches (?i)\bFRENCH\b DROP
  [release] matches (?i)\biTALiAN\b DROP
  [release] matches (?i)\bPOLISH\b DROP

Examples:
  The.Carman.Family.Deaths.2025.POLISH.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP
    → Dropped by POLISH rule.

  The.Hand.That.Rocks.the.Cradle.2025.FRENCH.720p.WEB.H264-GROUP
    → Dropped by FRENCH rule.

Alternative, less precise:
  [release] iswm *.GERMAN.* DROP

RULE PRIORITY (VERY IMPORTANT)
-------------------------------

The rules engine evaluates in this order:

1) Section DROP rules (for this IRC section)
   - If any matches → release is DROPPED immediately.

2) Tag rules (for the selected mapping)
   - Checked only if the mapping's trigger matched.
   - If a Tag rule matches, its ACTION (ALLOW/DROP) wins for that mapping.

3) Section ALLOW rules (for this IRC section)
   - Checked only if no Section DROP and no Tag rule matched.

4) Default
   - If no rules match anywhere → ALLOW.

So practically:
- Section rules are global for that IRC section.
- Tag rules let you fine-tune per CBFTP mapping.
- DROP always wins when it matches.

================================================================================
6. TAG RULES vs SECTION RULES - CRITICAL DISTINCTION
================================================================================

Section Rules (per IRC section)
-------------------------------

- Located in the bottom-right ""Section Rules"" box.
- Apply to ALL mappings under that IRC section.
- Evaluated first: all DROP rules, then ALLOW rules.
- Great for global blocks:
    [release] contains INTERNAL DROP
    [group]   isin BadGroup1,BadGroup2 DROP
    [release] matches (?i)\bPOLISH\b DROP

Tag Rules (per mapping / per CBFTP section)
-------------------------------------------

- Located in the top-right bottom box:
    ""CBFTP Mapping Rules: DROP run before ALLOW rules""
- Apply ONLY to the selected mapping in ""Mapped Section"".
- Evaluated after Section DROP rules.
- Good for:
    - Quality filters per mapping
    - Group whitelists per mapping
    - Special rules for MOVIES-HD vs MOVIES-LQ etc.

Hierarchy:

  Site
  └── IRC Section: MOVIES-HD
      ├── Section Rules (affect all mappings in MOVIES-HD)
      ├── Mapping A: MOVIES-HD → X264-HD-1080P
      │   └── Tag Rules for X264-HD-1080P only
      └── Mapping B: MOVIES-HD → X264-HD-720P
          └── Tag Rules for X264-HD-720P only

Remember:
- Section Rules = wide net (per IRC section).
- Tag Rules     = narrow net (per mapping).

================================================================================
7. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
================================================================================

EXAMPLE: Shared CBFTP section (MOVIES-HD) with different per-site filters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal:
- Use one shared CBFTP section: MOVIES-HD.
- SiteAlpha must be strict: only 1080p.
- SiteBeta can send both 720p and 1080p.

CBFTP:
  Section: MOVIES-HD
  - CBFTP is configured so MOVIES-HD exists for both SiteAlpha and SiteBeta
    with their own paths.

SiteAlpha configuration:
------------------------

IRC Sections:
  - X264-HD-1080P    (path on SiteAlpha is also X264-HD-1080P)

Race Sections (irc):
  - X264-HD-1080P is **Enabled**.

Mapping:
  - Select IRC Section: X264-HD-1080P.
  - Select CBFTP Section: MOVIES-HD.
  - Click ""Map"" → shows in ""Mapped Section"".
  - Mapping trigger (regex): .*

Section Rules (for IRC section X264-HD-1080P):
  [release] contains 720p DROP
  [release] contains CAM DROP
  [release] contains HDCAM DROP

Tag Rules (for MOVIES-HD mapping on SiteAlpha):
  (optional; you can leave empty, the Section Rules already block 720p)

Result (SiteAlpha):
  - Movie.Name.2025.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP  → ALLOWED → MOVIES-HD.
  - Movie.Name.2025.720p.WEB.H264-GROUP   → DROPPED (contains 720p).

SiteBeta configuration:
-----------------------

IRC Sections:
  - X264-HD      (path on SiteBeta is X264-HD)

Race Sections (irc):
  - X264-HD is **Enabled**.

Mapping:
  - Select IRC Section: X264-HD.
  - Select CBFTP Section: MOVIES-HD.
  - Click ""Map"".
  - Mapping trigger (regex): .*

Section Rules (for IRC section X264-HD):
  [release] contains CAM DROP
  [release] contains HDCAM DROP

Tag Rules (for MOVIES-HD mapping on SiteBeta):
  (none - SiteBeta allows both 720p and 1080p)

Result (SiteBeta):
  - Movie.Name.2025.1080p.WEB.H264-GROUP  → ALLOWED → MOVIES-HD.
  - Movie.Name.2025.720p.WEB.H264-GROUP   → ALLOWED → MOVIES-HD.

Summary:
--------
- Both sites race into the same CBFTP section MOVIES-HD.
- On SiteAlpha, the IRC section X264-HD-1080P has Section Rules that drop 720p.
- On SiteBeta, the IRC section X264-HD does not drop 720p.
- CBFTP paths are per site inside the MOVIES-HD section; RaceTrade only
  cares about which CBFTP section name to use per site.

================================================================================
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

(Short version – focused on current behaviour.)

Problem: Nothing is being raced
-------------------------------

Checklist:
- Is the IRC section present in ""IRC Sections""?
- Is that section **Enabled** in ""Race Sections (irc)""?
- Is there at least one mapping in ""Mapped Section"" for that IRC section?
- Does the mapping's trigger regex match? (try .*)
- Are Section DROP rules blocking everything?
- Did you click all the ""Save"" buttons (trigger save + site save)?

Fix:
- Temporarily remove all rules.
- Use .* as trigger.
- Enable Debug Mode and watch Application + Race logs.

Problem: Releases going to wrong CBFTP section
----------------------------------------------

- Check the order of mappings (first trigger that matches wins).
- Make specific triggers first, catch-all mapping with .* last.
- Check logs for which mapping was selected.

Problem: All releases are dropped
---------------------------------

- Look at Section Rules box:
    [release] matches .* DROP
  will drop everything for that IRC section.
- Remove or narrow overly broad DROP rules.
- Use debug mode: it will show:
    [DROP] Global DROP rule matched: ...

Problem: Hard to see what matched
---------------------------------

- Enable Debug Mode.
- Application log will show:
    [✓] Rule matched: [release] contains INTERNAL, Input='...'
- Race log shows when a release is filtered (FILTERED / DROPPED) vs raced.

Problem: IMDb API not working
-----------------------------

- IMDb now uses FREE imdbapi.dev - no API key needed!
- Test the API from Section Settings (Test IMDb button)
- Check Application log for error messages
- Verify internet connection
- API status: https://imdbapi.dev/

Problem: Rating shows weird decimals
------------------------------------

- This has been fixed in version 1.0.5b
- Ratings now display as 9.1 instead of 9.10000038146973
- If you still see this, make sure you're using the latest version

Problem: Application crashes or null reference exceptions
---------------------------------------------------------

- Version 1.0.5b has improved exception handling
- Enable Debug Mode to see detailed error messages
- Check Application log for stack traces
- Common causes:
  - CBFTP server not responding
  - IRC connection dropped
  - Malformed configuration JSON
  - Missing or invalid site settings

================================================================================
9. ADVANCED CONFIGURATIONS
================================================================================

Most of the original advanced configurations still apply:

- Multiple sites racing into the same CBFTP section.
- Using a prebot vs direct site announces.
- Group-whitelisting via Tag Rules on specific mappings.
- Language-based filtering with regex word boundaries.
- Quality-based routing by splitting 720p / 1080p / 2160p into different
  CBFTP sections with different mappings and rules.
- Performance tips:
    • Put global DROP rules in Section Rules.
    • Keep triggers simple where possible.
    • Place specific mappings (1080p, 2160p) before catch-all mappings.

Key reminder:
-------------
When mapping multiple real IRC sections (e.g. TV-DE on SiteAlpha
and X264-FOREIGN on SiteBeta) into a single CBFTP section (TV-DE):

- Configure that CBFTP section for both sites inside CBFTP.
- In each site's editor:
    IRC Section: TV-DE or X264-FOREIGN
    CBFTP Section: TV-DE
- Use Section Rules per site to express per-site preferences.

IMDB FILTERING TIPS:
-------------------

Since version 1.0.5b, RaceTrader uses the FREE imdbapi.dev API:

- No API key required - completely free!
- Better data with native arrays for genres, languages, countries
- More reliable than OMDB (no rate limits, no key expiration)
- Test connection from Section Settings → IMDb tab → Test IMDb button

Example IMDb filters in Section Settings:
- Minimum Rating: 7.0
- Minimum Votes: 10000
- Allowed Genres: Action, Thriller, Sci-Fi
- Blocked Genres: Documentary, Musical
- Only English Language: ✓
- Only US Country: ✓

The IMDb cache stores results for 30 days by default to minimize API calls
and improve performance.

TVMAZE FILTERING:
----------------

Similar to IMDb but for TV shows:
- Filter by rating, status, genres
- Network filtering (Netflix, HBO, Amazon, etc.)
- Skip ended/cancelled shows
- Configurable cache duration

CHAT FUNCTIONALITY:
------------------

Version 1.0.3b+ includes full IRC chat:
- Tabbed interface for multiple channels
- FiSH encryption with visual indicators
- DH1080 key exchange for secure PMs
- Chat-only mode (no racing)
- Configure chat keys separately from racing keys

To use chat:
1. Configure chat_keys in site config (separate from racing keys)
2. Click ""Chat"" button on main form
3. Select chat channels when connecting
4. Use context menu for key exchange and channel management

================================================================================
END OF GUIDE
================================================================================

Need help? Enable Debug Mode and check:

- Application log  – rules & config messages
- IRC log          – announces and connection status
- CBFTP log        – spreadjob status
- Race log         – [DETECTED], [RACING], [COMPLETED], [FAILED]

In almost all cases, the problem is:
- Section not Enabled in ""Race Sections (irc)""
- Missing mapping (you forgot to click ""Map"")
- Trigger regex not matching (too strict)
- Section DROP rule too broad
- Confusing Section Rules vs Tag Rules
- Forgot to click ""Save""

Happy Racing! 🏁
